# ShopChest

ShopChest - Spigot/Bukkit Plugin

## Branch specification

This branch intend to do all the testing in order to use gradle as build tool.

## API

For the moment, the project structure can change a lot, and there is no official API planned.
If you want to use ShopChest functionality, just add the .jar with the version you want to use to your project.
Maybe in future I will post an official API through github packages, but currently I don't have the time.

## Build

The whole purpose of this branch is to test gradle so currently there is no instructions

## Issues

If you find any issues, please provide them in the [Issues Section](https://github.com/Flowsqy/ShopChest/issues) with a
good description of how to reproduce it. If you get any error messages in the console, please also provide them.

## Download

I don't post build for this branch as it's in progress. If you want to use it, build it.
